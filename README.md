This is a classification project to classify if a machine has a failure or not using xgboost

Training Dataset : [train.csv](https://github.com/IAMSAGAYAABINESH/binary-classification-of-machine-failure/files/12300161/train.csv)

Test Dataset : [test.csv](https://github.com/IAMSAGAYAABINESH/binary-classification-of-machine-failure/files/12300174/test.csv)

train.csv - the training dataset; Machine failure is the (binary) target (which, in order to align with the ordering of the original dataset, is not in the last column position)

test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of Machine failure

Thank You! :)
